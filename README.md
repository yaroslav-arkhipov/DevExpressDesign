The application was created using the QuantumGrid tool from the DevExpress component set. The project uses several interesting features, for example: dynamic creation of pictures, adding records to the database when clicking on the last row in cxGrid, dynamic display of icons in the Grid columns when hovering with the mouse, etc.

The demo database will be attached to the project. You need to connect it to TFDConnection. Assemble and the project is ready for use.
